Simple mod that allows you to put exact amounts into storage (my use-case was the cargo module), like 100kg of coal + 1000kg of copper ore, etc.
To use: click the new "Enable Partitions" Button on the building, select what types of stuff you want to store, then enter the amounts. Can be removed/added to existing saves, though if you delete the mod you may have to re-check previously enabled building and reset the the "store only up to x kg" slider.

Works right now for (smart) storage bins, Orbital Cargo Modules, and Ration Box/Refrigerators.

New with 1.0.6: - support also Freezer and Dupes Refrigeration mods (made by llunak)
				- Added support for Gravitas Shipping Container (made by patricklecuyer)
				- Added support for Conveyor Recepticles (made by TheFantasticLoki)
