Prevents Cooking Stations, Microbe Mushers and Fish Feeders from using mutated seeds - until you allow them to do that with a new button. Unidentified seeds are always denied.
Will not remove seeds from stations, only prevents new seeds from being added.

New with 1.0.2: Option to add this feature to Conveyor Loaders
